# Macro_analysis_US
Few codes about USA macroeconomics 

The idea of the codes here is to analyse the relationship between macroeconomic variables such as Gross Domestic Product, Money Supply, Inflation, Interest
rates, Unemployment rate, and etc... I like to use different techniques and models in order to see how the economy is behaving.
